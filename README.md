## Working

*   You can get going with Haskell using [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters)
*   Most code you want is in `src/`
*   You can learn what (most) other files are at [Inner workings of stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/GUIDE/#inner-workings-of-stack).
*   If you want to add a Haskell package dependency, see [Adding dependencies](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/GUIDE/#adding-dependencies).
